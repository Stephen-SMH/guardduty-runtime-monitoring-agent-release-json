GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring Agent Release History as JSON
https://guarddutysha.cageyv.dev/guardduty_runtime_image_sha256.json

# Main problem
AWS doesnâ€™t expose GuardDuty runtime monitoring agent versions (for Fargate) via an API.
# Solution
This repository contains a JSON file with the release history of the GuardDuty runtime monitoring agent.

# Help required:
- "GuardDuty security agent versions for Amazon EKS resources" image tags is unkown for me and I just guess them with `v1.10.0-Eks_x86_64` pattern
